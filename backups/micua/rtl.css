 * The right-to-left stylesheet is included automatically if the website languageâ€™s text direction is right-to-left.
 *
 * Adding support for languages written in a Right To Left (RTL) direction is easy -
 * it's just a matter of overwriting all the horizontal positioning attributes
 * of your CSS stylesheet in a separate stylesheet file named rtl.css.
